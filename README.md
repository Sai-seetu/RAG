# RAG

Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project implements a RAG-based chatbot for answering restaurant-related queries using Llama-2-7B. It combines retrieval-based search with LLM-generated responses to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

Features
âœ… Data Ingestion: Loads and processes restaurant-related text from PDFs and TXT files.
âœ… Vector Storage: Embeds and stores documents in FAISS for efficient retrieval.
âœ… Retrieval & Query Processing: Uses RetrievalQA to fetch relevant documents.
âœ… LLM Integration: Utilizes Llama-2-7B to generate responses.
âœ… Fallback Mechanism: Handles unknown queries by leveraging LLM general knowledge.

Challenges & Solutions
âš¡ Storage Constraints: Due to Colab storage limits, opted for 7B over 13B.
âš¡ Response Accuracy: Working on improving document retrieval & fallback mechanisms.

Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ Implement hybrid search for better retrieval.
ðŸš€ Improve LLM-based responses for unknown queries.
ðŸš€ Explore fine-tuning for domain-specific accuracy.
